# Cocktail Shopping List

**Cocktail Shopping List** is a small application developed for Neovici. This project marks my first experience with `lit-html`, and I found it quite enjoyable to work with. However, there were a couple of challenges I encountered, specifically regarding:

- **Sharing Styles:** I found it difficult to share common styles across components, such as resetting CSS or applying global styles. While I came across the `styleMap` function, Iâ€™m still exploring how best to use it for this purpose.
- CSS Improvements: The CSS could have been written better with shared styles, reusable variables, and a more refined design. However, since this is a basic showcase application, the aim was to demonstrate a wide range of skills across different aspects of frontend development.
